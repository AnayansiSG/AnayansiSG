## Aboout me
Greetings from the Sequencing and Bioinformatics Department at the CNRF! 

I am Anayansi SolÃ­s, a dedicated researcher passionate about unraveling the mysteries of pathogens through cutting-edge genomics and bioinformatics approaches. In my role, I specialize in the diagnostic exploration of pathogens employing a multifaceted approach. My key areas of expertise include: 

- **Genomics:** Unraveling the genetic codes of pathogens to decode their secrets.
- **Phylogenomics:** Tracing the evolutionary relationships of pathogens to enhance our understanding of their origins and behavior.
- **Metagenomics:** Delving into complex microbial communities to identify and characterize pathogens within diverse environments.
- **Primer Design:** Developing precise molecular tools for targeted detection and analysis.
